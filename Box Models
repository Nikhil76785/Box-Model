        <h1>Coding!!!</h1>

        <p class="eg1">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the
        creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such
        as tags and attributes.
        
        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:
        
        Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks,
        and media files.
        Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily
        used to embed hyperlinks.
        Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>
        <p class="eg2">Scratch is a high-level, block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an
        educational tool, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[9][10] Users on the site can create projects on the website
        using a block-like interface. Scratch was conceived and designed through collaborative National Science Foundation
        grants awarded to Mitchel Resnick and Yasmin Kafai.[11] Scratch is developed by the MIT Media Lab and has been
        translated into 70+ languages, being used in most parts of the world. Scratch is taught and used in after-school
        centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions. As of 15 February 2023, community
        statistics on the language's official website show more than 123 million projects shared by over 103 million users, and
        more than 95 million monthly website visits.[12] Overall, over 1 billion total projects have been created (including
        unshared projects), with the site reaching its 1,000,000,000th project in April 2024.</p>
        <p class="eg3">Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built
        in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application
        Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's
        simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python
        supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the
        extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be
        freely distributed.</p>
        <p class="eg4">Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can
        follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of
        procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming
        languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
        processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of
        the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal
        logic.</p>
